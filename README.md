MERN stack app that allows a user to create a reading list of books by querying Google books.

"Search Books" takes the user to a search page the queries Google books. Submit button is disabled until user enters either a title or author. Ten results are returned, each one with a "Save" button allowing the user to add that book to their personlized reading list.

"My Books" takes the user to their personalized reading list, which is stored in MongoDB. Each stored item displays (where applicable) title, author, description, and a thumbnail of the book cover.
